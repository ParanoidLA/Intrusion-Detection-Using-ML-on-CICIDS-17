##  CICIDS2017 csv files are required for the operation of the program.
##  These files must be located under the "CSVs" folder in the same directory as the program.



##  The purpose of this program is to clear the csv files containing CICIDS2017 data from errors.
##  the faults observed are:
##      1-   288602 of the entries in the file "Thursday-WorkingHours-Morning-WebAttacks.pcap_ISCX.csv" are empty / meaningless.
##                   (e.g. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,")
##
##      2-  In the original csv files, while describing the Web Attack types such as Brute Force, XSS, Sql Injection, the character used is not recognized
##                    by the Python-Pandas library and leads to the error.
##                    this character ("–", Unicode code:8211) has been changed with another character ("-", Unicode code:45) to correct the error.
##
##   After the error correction, all the csv files were made into a single file (all_date.csv) to make it easier to process.
